# Stack-Queue-Bookstore
This is a program using stack and queue that resembles a bookstore buying and selling books and storing them in either a queue or a stack.
The program reads an input file and does what it asks - either buy or sell. Then it will output to an output file whenever it encounters 
a "sell" command informing the user where the book was located in the stack and queue then removing it or whether the book was not in the stack and queue. When it encounters a "buy" command, it adds the book to the stack and queue but doesn't output anything to the output file.
